# connery dev add-action

Run this command at the root of your project. You will be asked a few questions to configure the action and then the CLI will create the necessary files for it and add it to the plugin.

```
npx connery@latest dev add-action
```

The project must have been initialized with [`connery dev init`](connery-dev-init.md) before running this command.
