# Core concepts

## Action

Think of an action as a basic task, something like a function with input and output parameters designed to do one specific thing.

{% hint style="info" %}
[Send email](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail/blob/main/src/actions/sendEmail.ts) is an action in a [Gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin.
{% endhint %}

## Plugin

The plugin is a way to organize actions, provide a common configuration for them, and expose them with a standard API to clients.

Each plugin is represented by a GitHub repository and uses Connery SDK to define the actions and configuration. Once the plugin is implemented, the Connery SDK wraps it into a web service that provides a standard API for interacting with its actions.

We aim to create a rich ecosystem of open-source plugins that empower the community.

{% hint style="info" %}
The [Gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin has a set of actions related to Gmail.
{% endhint %}

## Plugin Server[â€‹](https://sdk.connery.io/docs/introduction/core-concepts#plugin-server) <a href="#plugin-server" id="plugin-server"></a>

A plugin server is a web service generated by Connery SDK around a plugin. It provides a standardized REST API for interacting with the plugin's actions.
