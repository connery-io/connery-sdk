# Core concepts

## Action

Think of an action as a basic task, similar to a function with input and output parameters, designed to perform a specific purpose. It can act as a wrapper for one or more APIs or implement standalone business logic.

For example, [Send email](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail/blob/main/src/actions/sendEmail.ts) is an action in a [Gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin.

## Plugin

A plugin is a way to organize and bundle similar actions together.

For example, The [Gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin has a set of actions related to Gmail.

## Plugin Server[​](https://sdk.connery.io/docs/introduction/core-concepts#plugin-server) <a href="#plugin-server" id="plugin-server"></a>

A plugin server is a web service generated by the Connery SDK to host a plugin. It provides a standardized REST API for interacting with the plugin’s actions, which is consumed by apps. The plugin server takes care of authorization, input validation, and logging, allowing you to focus on the core logic of your actions.

## Plugin Repository

Each plugin is represented by a standalone GitHub repository containing its definition and source code.&#x20;

All Connery plugins are open-source, designed to be reusable and beneficial for everyone. You can use them as-is or fork the repository to adapt them to your specific needs.
