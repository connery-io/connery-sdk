<summary>More about GitHub Codespaces</summary>

GitHub Codespace is the fastest way to start a development environment without installing additional software on your machine.

Use the green **Code** button in the top right corner of your repository. Then open the **Codespaces** tab and click **Create codespace on main**. It will start the codespace creation process.

GitHub Codespaces are [free of charge for 120 hours per month](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts) for personal accounts.&#x20;

By default, a codespace stops running after [30 minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/setting-your-timeout-period-for-github-codespaces?tool=webui#about-the-idle-timeout) of inactivity to safe resources.
