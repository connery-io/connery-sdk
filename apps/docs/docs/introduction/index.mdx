## What is this?

## Mission and vision

- One action - multiple opportunities.
- "Connector first" approach
- Show the problem that every platform nowadays build their own connectors platform.
  Closed source, not extensible, not customizable, not shareable.
  And there is no way to share one connector between different platforms.
  But also there is no connector economy where you can grab existing connector, customize it and use it for your own needs.
