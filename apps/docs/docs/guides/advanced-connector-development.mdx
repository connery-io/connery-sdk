# Advanced connector development

## Develop on the local machine

## Automatic build

> (mode it to advanced section) Now your files are synchronized to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository. The `main` branch is monitored by a GitHub Action workflow which automatically build and package your connector with all the dependencies into a `./dist/connector.js` file in the repository. This file is used by Connery Runner to run your connector.
> You can find the "Build connector" workflow in the "Actions" tab of the repository.

## Unit testing

## Validate connector

## /dist/connector.js

## How the Runner runs connector?

## Install dependencies

## Versioning

branches and tags

## Private connectors

We endorse creating a public repository so the connector can be shared with the community.
However, you can also create a private repository if you want to keep the connector's code private.
In this case, you will need to configure your runner so it can access the private repository.
