# OpenGPTs

[OpenGPTs](https://github.com/langchain-ai/opengpts) is an open-source effort from LangChain to create a similar experience to OpenAI's GPTs and Assistants API.

Connery is integrated with OpenGPTs so you can run Connery actions from OpenGPTs without any additional setup.

:::warning IMPORTANT

This page is compatible with the [`v0.0.8`](https://github.com/connery-io/connery/releases/tag/v0.0.8) version of the Connery Runner.

In the meantime, we released [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/connery-io/connery/releases/tag/v0.1.0) with the **breaking changes**, where we pivoted the project from Connery Runner to Connery SDK.
See the release notes to learn more about the changes.

The LangChain OpenGPTs client does not yet support the new version, but we are working on it. Stay tuned for updates.

# How to set up OpenGPTs with Connery

To configure your own OpenGPT and actions, perform the following steps:

1. Set up the Connery Runner using the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart/) guide.
2. Install plugins with the actions you want to use in your agent.
3. Fork the [OpenGPTs repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/opengpts) and configure it as specified in the README.
4. Specify the `CONNERY_RUNNER_URL` and `CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY` environment variables in the `.env` file of the OpenGPTs to connect it to your Connery Runner.
