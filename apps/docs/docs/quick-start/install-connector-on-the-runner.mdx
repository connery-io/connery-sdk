# Install connector on the runner

Here, you will learn how to install a connector on the runner.

## 1. Open and understand the configuration file

Open the runner configuration file `./apps/runner/connery-runner.config.ts` in the codespace.

Among the other configuration parameters, you can see the `InstalledConnectors` section.
`InstalledConnectors` is an array of connector configurations already containing one connector: `connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main`.
This connector is used to manage the runner, and it's preinstalled on the runner by default.

```ts
...
InstalledConnectors: [
  {
    Key: 'connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main',
    ConfigurationParameters: {
      RunenrUrl: 'http://localhost:4201',
      RunnerApiKey: process.env.CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY,
    },
  },
],
...
```

Every connector configuration has the `Key` and `ConfigurationParameters` properties.

The `Key` is a unique connector identifier with the following format: `owner/repository@branch`.
As you can see, it directly relates to the GitHub repository where the connector is stored.
For example, the `connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main` connector is stored
in the https://github.com/connery-io/connery-runner-administration GitHub repository and uses the code from the `main` branch.
The branch is used for versioning and can be replaced with a tag.

The `ConfigurationParameters` is a flat key-value object containing the connector's configuration parameters.
Configuration parameters are specific for each connector; you can find them in the connector definition file in the related GitHub repository.
For example, the `connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main` connector has the configuration parameters
defined in the `configurationParameters` section of its definition file [index.js](https://github.com/connery-io/connery-runner-administration/blob/main/index.js) in the root of the GitHub repository.
The definition file shows that both `RunenrUrl` and `RunnerApiKey` configuration parameters are required, so they must be provided in the connector configuration.

The actions of this connector use the configuration parameters to perform their tasks.

## 2. Add connector configuration

Let's install the [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) connector on the runner.
It has an action that sends an email using the Gmail API.

:::info Connectior versioning
You can install the connector from the `main` branch, so you always use the newest connector code from the main branch.
However, this won't be as stable as the tagged versions. The connector can be in the development stage on the `main` branch.
When on the tagged version, the code is stable, and once the new version tag is released, the code won't be changed anymore for this version.
You can find the latest version of the connector in it's repository.

For example, for the `connery-io/gmail` connector, the latest version is `v1.0.0` on the date of writing this article.
We will use this version in the example below.
:::

First, we need to check the connector definition file [index.js](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail/blob/main/index.js) and find the configuration parameters we need to provide.
Based on the definition file, the configuration parameters are:

- `GmailEmailAddress` (required)
- `GmailAppPassword` (required)
- `SenderName` (optional)

So let's add the connector configuration to the end of the `InstalledConnectors` array in the runner configuration file like the following:

```ts
...
configurationParameters: [
  ...
  {
    Key: 'connery-io/gmail@v1.0.0', // NOTE: We use the tagged version v1.0.0 here. However, you can use any other tagged version or the branch name here.
    ConfigurationParameters:
    {
      GmailEmailAddress: '<GMAIL_EMAIL_ADRESS>',
      GmailAppPassword: '<GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD>',
      SenderName: '<SENDER_NAME>'
    }
  }
],
...
```

Replace the `<GMAIL_EMAIL_ADRESS>`, `<GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD>` and `<SENDER_NAME>` placeholders with the actual values.<br/>
Check the [Sign in with app passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) article from Google Support to learn how to generate the app password for your Gmail account.

If the runner is still running in your codespace, the configuration will be automatically applied after saving the file.
On the next API request to the runner, it will download the connector from the GitHub repository and cache it.

:::info

If you want to install a connector from the private GitHub repository, configure the Personal Access Token (`GITHUB_PAT`) in the `.env` file.
So the runner can access the private repository and can download the connector.

:::

If you want to update the installed connectors with the latest changes from their repositories,
run the `ClearConnectorCache` action of the `connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main` connector as was shown [on the previous page](/docs/quick-start/set-up-runner#run-action-using-api).
It will clean the connectors cache on the runner and download the latest version of the connectors from the specified branch or tag.
You don't need to restart the runner after that.

Now, when you have the runner configured and the connectors installed, you can learn how to [use clients](/docs/quick-start/use-clients-to-call-actions) to call actions from the connectors.
