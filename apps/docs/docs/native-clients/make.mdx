# Make App

Run actions from the no-code platform [Make](https://www.make.com/) using them in your workflows and combining them with the other apps and capabilities of Make.

## Information

The advantage of using the Make app is that you can use actions from your runner as a part of no-code workflows and combine them with the other apps and capabilities of Make.

The Make App has the following actions:

| Make action (module)              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run action                        | This Make action lets you select an action from the runner, specify input parameters, and run it.<br/><br/>This action does not use OpenAI API and runs actions directly from the runner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Run action using natural language | This Make action lets you run action from the runner using natural language, similar to how the [Connery app in Slack](/docs/native-clients/slack#information) works using OpenAI API for classification.<br/><br/>To use the app, you must configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the [runner configuration](http://localhost:4202/docs/quick-start/set-up-runner#3-configure-env-variables) so the runner can use OpenAI API to classify the user intent and identify input parameters from messages. |

:::info Tricky terminology

Please note that Make also uses the term "action" to describe a simple operation. Sometimes they also call it a "module", though.

The Make actions listed in the table above are proxies that allow you to call actions from your Connery runner.
That's why the app has an action called "Run action" 🤭

## Installation

:::caution

Currently, the app is not yet published in the Make App Store.
So, you need to explicitly install it to your Make organization using the invitation link behind the button.

:::

Use the button below to install the app to your Make organization.

## Configuration

To call actions from your runner, you need to create a new scenario in Make and
configure the connection to the runner by providing the Runner URL and the API Key.

Follow the steps below to configure the connection:

1. Press the **"+"** button to add a new application to your scenario.

![Slack App Configuration](/img/make/create-scenario1.png)

2. Search for **Connery** in the search field.
3. Select the **Connery** app in the list.

4. Select **Run action** from the list of actions in the **Connery** app.

5. Press the **Create a connection** button.
6. Provide the **Runner URL**.
7. Provide the **API Key**.
8. Press the **Save** button to create the connection.

Once the connection is created, you can start using actions from your runner in your workflows as described below.

## Usage

In the example below, we will use the **Send email** action from the **Gmail** connector from the runner.

Once you create the connection, it will be automatically selected as an active connection for the action.
After you choose **Gmail** connector and **Send email** action,
the form will reload, and you will see all the input parameters for the action.

Let's fill in the form and run the action.

1. Specify the **Email Recipient**.
2. Specify the **Email Subject**.
3. Specify the **Email Body**.
4. Press the **OK** button to save the action.

5. Press the **Run once** button to run the scenario.
6. Press the bubble to see the result of the action execution.

![Slack App Configuration](/img/make/create-scenario6.png)

In the result execution, you will see the **Message ID** output parameter of the action.
Also, you can see all the input parameters used to run the action.
You can use the output parameters of the action in the next steps of your workflow if you need to.

Also, you can use the Connery app in combination with the thousands of other apps in Make.
For example, in this case you can read data about email recipients from Google Sheets and use it as input parameters for the **Send email** action.
So when you run the scenario, the action will send emails to all the recipients from the Google Sheets.

Below, you can see how the **Send email** action uses the input parameters from the Google Sheets.
