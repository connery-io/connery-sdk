# Slack App

Use natural language in the familiar Slack interface to run your actions using the Connery chatbot.

Under the hood, the chatbot uses Connery API, which
utilizes [OpenAI function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling)
to classify the user intent, identify input parameters from the message,
and run the appropriate action from the runner.

You can use the app by sending it direct messages or in any channel
where the app is invited. In the channels, the app can see and respond
only to messages where the app is mentioned.

:::caution
Currently, the app is not yet published in the Slack App Directory. 
So you can see the "This app is not approved by Slack" warning during installation.
