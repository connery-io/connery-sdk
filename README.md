## 🤔 What is this?

**Connery is a middle layer between APIs and platforms.
It allows wrapping any API into a connector written in JavaScript, standardizing it,
and then using the connector from any platform.**

There are many platforms around that allow you to connect different services together and build automation workflows.
For example, no-code platforms like Zapier and Make.
Also, many AI-powered platforms are gaining momentum on the market — for instance, ChatGPT with its plugins,
AI-powered chatbots, and agents.

All of them must be connected to third-party services to provide integration and automation capabilities to the end users.
API is not enough for that nowadays, as it should always be wrapped into the native app following
the requirements of each platform. This also brings many new challenges around security, access management, and more.

This is where Connery comes into play using three concepts:

**1. Connectors**

The connector is a piece of configuration and JavaScript code that wraps any API
and helps standardize it for any platform.

You might already be familiar with the concept of a connector.
This idea has different names across various platforms:

- **App** in Make, Zapier, and Slack;
- **Plugin** in ChatGPT;
- **Tool** in LangChain.

**2. Runner**

The runner is an open-source application that knows how to run connectors and provide a standardized API as an output.
Also, it offers many important features to ensure the security of your connectors,
like Authentication and Authorization, Access Management, Secret Management, Audit Logs,
but also the features that make your connectors more powerful, like Natural Language Actions with LLM support, Manual Approval, and many more.

**3. Clients**

The client is a native application on every platform that consumes the API provided
by the runner and lets the end users use connectors without technical knowledge.

## ✅ Real example

Let's consider a real example from one of our customers.

**Problem**

The customer aimed to scale their application on AWS in response to various business conditions and events.
Additionally, they wanted the flexibility to manually scale the application as needed.
Importantly, the scaling process should be user-friendly enough for team members who are experts
in the business domain but not familiar with AWS or the technical aspects managed by the engineering team.

**Solution**

The customer created a connector with two actions that allow to scale up and down the compute resources of the app in AWS.
The connector uses AWS SDK for JavaScript to communicate with AWS.
After creating the connector, the customer configured a runner and installed the connector onto it.
This setup enabled the customer to use the connector from multiple platforms using clients and supporting a range of use cases:

| Client                                                         | Use case                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Make App](https://docs.connery.io/docs/native-clients/make)   | Scenario for smart scaling based on the input from other services connected to Make — for example, Google Sheets with the related data.                                 |
| [Make App](https://docs.connery.io/docs/native-clients/make)   | Scenario for scheduled scaling based on the time of the day and day of the week.                                                                                        |
| [Slack App](https://docs.connery.io/docs/native-clients/slack) | Manual scaling directly from Slack channel using natural language.                                                                                                      |
| Apple Shortcut                                                 | There was even the case when the customer scaled the app on the go from their Apple Watch with Siri using preconfigured Apple Shortcuts connected by API to the runner. |

The most beautiful thing is that once the connector is implemented by the developer and hosted on the runner,
non-technical people can easily use it from any platform that covers their needs.

For many cases, you don't even need developers, as Connery brings many community-driven connectors and clients -
