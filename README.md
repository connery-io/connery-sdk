## 🤔 What is Connery SDK?

Connery SDK is an NPM package that includes both an SDK and a CLI, designed for the development
of [plugins](https://sdk.connery.io/docs/introduction/core-concepts#plugin)
and [actions](https://sdk.connery.io/docs/introduction/core-concepts#action).

The CLI automates many things in the development process.
Meanwhile, the SDK offers a JavaScript API for defining plugins and actions and packaging them
into a [plugin server](https://sdk.connery.io/docs/introduction/core-concepts#plugin-server) with a standardized REST API generated from the metadata.
The plugin server handles authorization, input validation, and logging.
So you can focus on the logic of your actions.

The standardized API enables various [clients](https://sdk.connery.io/docs/introduction/core-concepts#client) to interact
with actions in a unified way, regardless of the underlying implementation.

An action consists of JavaSctipt code that defines its logic and metadata that describes its input and output.
The action can communicate with external APIs, databases, or other services.

👉 _Example: [Send email](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail/blob/main/src/actions/sendEmail.ts)
is an action in the [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin._

## 🚀 Quickstart

Initialize a new plugin with a sample action:

```bash
npx connery@latest dev init
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the plugin server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open the plugin in the browser: [localhost:4201](http://localhost:4201).
